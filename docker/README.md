# Experimental: Running OpenAM in Docker / Kubernetes (k8)

NOTE: Most of these images are now kept in another project

See https://github.com/ForgeRock/docker 



What is here:

haproxy/ - an haproxy Docker image, but also a script to run haproxy in from your laptop.
   For running on k8 you probably dont need haproxy - since you can use the GCE load balancer
